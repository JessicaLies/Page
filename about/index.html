  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    As a soon-to-be graduate with a professional degree in Architecture, I am highly self-motivated, passionate, and equipped with diverse experience in various architectural disciplines. Throuh varied internships I have proven to be a valuable asset to several companies and groups. I strengthen teams by sharing innovative ideas and contributing work to achieve a common goal with excellence. I am looking to pursue opportunities which will allow me to share fresh ideas and help cultivate work and client satisfaction while enhancing my experience and skills.
